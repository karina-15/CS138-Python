# Problem Statement: Programming Exercise #4 p.424
#   Write a program that simulates an Automatic Teller Machine
#   (ATM). Since you probably don't have access to a card reader,
#   have the initial screen ask for user id and a PIN. The user
#   is will be user to look up the info for the user's accounts
#   (including the PIN to see if it matches what the user types).
#   Each user will have access to a checking account and a savings
#   account. The user should be able to check balances, withdraw
#   cash, and transfer money between accounts. Design your interface
#   to be similar to what you see on your local ATM. The user
#   account information should be stored in a file when the
#   program terminates. This file will read in again when the
#   program restarts.
#
#
# Overall Plan:
# 1.
#
#
# import the necessary python libraries and classes
# for this program pokerapp, button, and cdieview are used
# from the textbook
